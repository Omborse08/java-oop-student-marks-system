# Java OOP Student Result System

This is a simple Java program that I built while learning the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

The goal of this project was to understand how classes, objects, methods, loops and user input work together in a real program.

## What this program do
- Takes student name and marks as input
- Validates marks (0–300 range)
- Assigns a roll number
- Displays student details
- Shows whether the student has passed or failed.

## Concepts used
- Classes and Objects
- Methods
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input using Scanner

## Why I built this
I created this project as part of my Java learning journey to move from basic syntax to writing structured programs using OOP concepts.

## Current status
This is a beginner-level project. I plan to improve it as I learn:
- Encapsulation (`private`)
- Constructors
- Collections (ArrayList)
- Better program structure
